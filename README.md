# deltaruined
a deltarune port to godot i tried to make but gave up here have the remnants

i made the battle scene completely by myself, no extra help
for the overworld there is a suppoed to be a combination of a follow pathfinding library by GDQuest you can find here: https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-demos/tree/master/2019/08-13-steering-follow-arrive/end and my custom text rendering code (https://github.com/Nathan-R-Og/GodotOpenLibraries/tree/main/Typewriter%20Text) as well as all new object depth rendering (basically just ordering by y, you can probably add flags to disable and add features idk)

i made the battle scene in 4 hours and is a great start so if anyone would like to continue this i dont care im just abandoning/storing it here for later
